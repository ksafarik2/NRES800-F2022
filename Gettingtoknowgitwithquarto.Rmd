## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

There are many options for [html-style](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) documents.

```{r example_yaml}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

## Working with the `palmerpenguin` dataset

As everyone always says,

> penguins are very cute! ...so let's work with penguin data today.

You can use special '[callout blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html)' to draw extra attention to certain concepts or supplementary material

::: callout-note
Note that the palmerpenguins dataset is meant as an alternative to the commonly used `iris` data.
:::

More information on this data set is available on [Allison Horst's Github page.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand to learn more about where the data was collected

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.
:::

### Excercise 2

Insert links for 1) Dr. Kristen Gorman and 2) Palmer Station

Change the call-out chunk title to something more informative
